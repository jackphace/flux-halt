flux-halt
=========

Small script for turning off Flux if there are sensitive windows.

There are two flavors:
One will toggle flux is a sensitive window exists
The other will toggle flux if the sensitive window is active (then reactivates the window cause the flux hotkey takes focus)

The script polls the sensitive windows listed in sensitive.txt every 4 seconds.

The source is in the .ahk files if you run autohotkey or want to check what I did.
There is also a compiled .exe version if you don't care to install autohotkey.

The whole project is in the "flux halt.rar" if you're not comfortable with Git.
